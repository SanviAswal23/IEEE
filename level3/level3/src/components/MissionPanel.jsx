In the center's embrace where four winds flow,
Both white and black, their banners show.
A knight may leap, a bishop glide,
The queen might cross this open wide.
From pawnâ€™s first step to regal dance,
This square invites each bold advance.
It's no mere corner, no edge to hide
Here, ambition and courage collide.
When eagles soar and battles thrive,
Only on this square can the dream survive.
